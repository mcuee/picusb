This page is mainly related to code and resources for Microchip USB PICs and libusb/libusb-win32 and libusb related stuff. For example, I may publish test binaries for libusb related projects (libusb-1.0 Windows backend, libusb-win32, libftdi and libftdi-1.0, OpenOCD windows binary). These test binaries are only for testing purpose and please follow the license (LGPL or GPL).

I also wrote some simple libusb based programs. Please take note I am not a good C programmer. Therefore you are welcome to send comments to me by using Microchip forum or maybe using libusb mailing list.<br>
